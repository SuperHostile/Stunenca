# Zariel-Engine
A game engine created in Lua for the Löve2d framework.

The Zariel Engine is a WIP game engine created on top of the Löve2d framework. 
It was originally made to power a simple rogue-lite game, but i decided to make it more general.
A simple example can be found in main.lua, i will provide more examples when the game engine goes to an alpha or beta state.
