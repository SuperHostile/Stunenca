Z Order 
Being able to change the order an object is drawn (gets events?)

Prototypes for objects (for memory saving)?
Easy to use dynamic objects

Grouping up objects
Easy access to every object

Node based system:
	Z Order issues
	Less performance for Z order

	-> Layering solves all of this



NO:
	Lists of objects 
	ECS

object:
	z = 0

-- Solving z order with this maybe xd
function draw() 
	renderer.send(
		"rectangle", {x = 0, y = 0, w = 16, h = 16}, 0
	)

	--lg.rectange("fill", 0, 0, 16, 16)

end
